# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

**Support policy**: we support the **two most recent minor release trains**. When a new minor ships, the oldest supported train reaches end of support. This is an honest reflection of what a small maintainer team can patch — older versions still work, but security fixes land only on supported trains.

| Version | Supported          | End of Support                      |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 7.3.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current                             |
| 7.2.x   | :white_check_mark: | When the second following minor ships |
| 7.1.x   | :x:                | Ended 2026-07-02                    |
| 7.0.x   | :x:                | Ended 2026-07-02                    |
| 6.x     | :x:                | Ended 2026-07-02                    |
| < 6.0   | :x:                | Ended                               |

**Recommendation**: Always upgrade to the latest release for the most recent security patches and features. Upgrade guides: [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) and [docs/OPERATOR_MIGRATION.md](docs/OPERATOR_MIGRATION.md).

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Credentials Management

**CRITICAL**: Never commit credentials to version control.

- Store all secrets in `.env` file (gitignored by default)
- Required secrets:
  ```bash
  ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME=your_username
  ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=...
  ```
- Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 16 characters)
- Rotate API keys every 90 days
- Never include `.env` in Docker images

### 2. Network Security

**Default Configuration** (Secure - all services bind to localhost):
| Service | Default Bind | Port | Remote Opt-in |
|---------|-------------|------|---------------|
| ai-engine Health | `127.0.0.1` (code) / `0.0.0.0` (shipped compose — see note) | 15000 | `HEALTH_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` |
| Admin UI | `127.0.0.1` | 3003 | `UVICORN_HOST=0.0.0.0` |
| Local AI Server | `127.0.0.1` | 8765 | `LOCAL_WS_HOST=0.0.0.0` |
| RTP Server | `127.0.0.1` | 18080 | `EXTERNAL_MEDIA_RTP_HOST=0.0.0.0` |
| AudioSocket | `127.0.0.1` | 8090 | `AUDIOSOCKET_HOST=0.0.0.0` |

> **Shipped docker-compose note:** `docker-compose.yml` sets `HEALTH_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0`
> for the ai-engine health server (port 15000) so the Admin UI container can reach
> `/sessions/stats` and `/reload`. On host-network deployments this exposes port 15000
> on all host interfaces. The health server carries no secrets but does expose
> operational state and a `/reload` trigger — firewall port 15000 from untrusted
> networks, or, if you do not use the Admin UI, set `HEALTH_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1`
> in the `ai_engine` service's `environment:` block in `docker-compose.yml`.
> (Setting it only in `.env` has no effect: the compose `environment:` value takes
> precedence over `env_file` — see the Docker Compose env-var precedence docs.)

**If Remote Access Required**:
```bash
# .env file - explicit opt-in required
HEALTH_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0         # ai-engine health endpoints
HEALTH_API_TOKEN=<strong-token>  # Required for /reload, /mcp/test/* from remote
UVICORN_HOST=0.0.0.0             # Admin UI (REQUIRES JWT_SECRET!)
JWT_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>  # Required when UVICORN_HOST != localhost
LOCAL_WS_HOST=0.0.0.0            # Local AI Server
LOCAL_WS_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>      # Required when LOCAL_WS_HOST != localhost
```

**Firewall Rules** (if binding to 0.0.0.0):
```bash
# Only allow from trusted IPs
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.1.5 to any port 18080  # RTP
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.1.5 to any port 8090   # AudioSocket
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.1.5 to any port 15000  # Health (if exposed)
```

### 2.1 Admin UI Security

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Admin UI is a Control Plane**

The Admin UI has Docker socket access for container management. If exposed remotely without proper security, this is effectively **root-equivalent access** to the host.

**Risk Summary**:
| Exposure | Risk Level | Impact |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Localhost only | Low | Expected use case |
| LAN without auth | **Critical** | Full host compromise possible |
| Internet without auth | **Critical** | Immediate compromise |
| Internet with JWT only | High | Brute-force/leak risk |
| Reverse proxy + mTLS | Low | Recommended production setup |

**Security Requirements**:
1. **Never expose directly to internet** - Always use reverse proxy with authentication
2. **JWT_SECRET is mandatory** - Service refuses to start if binding non-localhost without JWT_SECRET
3. **Network isolation** - Place admin-ui on management network only
4. **Least privilege** - Consider read-only Docker socket mounts if container management not needed
5. **Rotate the admin password** - AVA generates a one-time admin password on first start and forces a change at first login; never run with a shared or unrotated admin credential.

**Docker Socket Hardening**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Read-only socket (if only monitoring needed)
services:
  admin-ui:
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  # Read-only
```

```bash
# Alternative: Use docker-socket-proxy for granular control
# https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
docker run -d --name docker-proxy \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -e CONTAINERS=1 -e INFO=1 -e IMAGES=0 -e EXEC=0 \
  tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
```

**Recommended Production Setup**:
```nginx
# nginx reverse proxy with client cert auth (mTLS)
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/server.key;
    ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/client-ca.crt;
    ssl_verify_client on;
    
    # Rate limiting
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=admin:10m rate=10r/s;
    limit_req zone=admin burst=20 nodelay;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3003;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**Audit Logging** (recommended):
```bash
# Enable Docker daemon audit logging
# /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {"max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3"}
}
```

### 2.2 Sensitive Endpoint Protection

The following ai-engine endpoints require authorization:
- `POST /reload` - Hot-reload configuration
- `POST /mcp/test/{server_id}` - Test MCP server connections

**Authorization Methods**:
1. **Localhost access** - Automatically authorized from 127.0.0.1
2. **API Token** - Set `HEALTH_API_TOKEN` and include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

```bash
# Remote reload with token
curl -X POST http://ai_engine:15000/reload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HEALTH_API_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Docker Security

**Run as Non-Root**:
- Containers run as `appuser` (non-root) by default
- Never override this with `user: root`

**Keep Base Images Updated**:
```bash
# Check for updates
docker pull python:3.11@sha256:e8ab764baee5109566456913b42d7d4ad97c13385e4002973c896e1dd5f01146

# Rebuild
docker compose build --no-cache
```

### 4. Dependency Security

**Automated Scanning** (enabled via CI):
- **Dependabot**: Weekly dependency updates
- **Trivy**: Docker vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis

**Manual Checks**:
```bash
# Check Python dependencies
pip list --outdated

# Scan for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit
```

### 5. Logging Security

**Log Sanitization** (automatic):
- API keys, passwords, tokens automatically redacted in logs
- Example: `api_key: "sk***REDACTED***"`
- Implemented via structlog processor (AAVA-37)

**Log Access Control**:
```bash
# Restrict log file permissions
chmod 640 logs/*.log
chown appuser:appgroup logs/*.log
```

### 6. Production Hardening

**Required for Production**:
- [ ] Change default credentials
- [ ] Enable firewall (ufw/iptables)
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Enable monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Regular backup schedule
- [ ] TLS/SSL for external access
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Production settings
LOG_LEVEL=info              # Not debug (security risk)
STREAMING_LOG_LEVEL=info    # Not debug (performance impact)
```

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. API Provider Dependencies

This application integrates with third-party AI providers:
- **OpenAI**: Processes audio/text via their API
- **Deepgram**: Processes audio via their API
- **Google**: (If configured) Processes audio via their API

**Privacy Implications**:
- Audio is transmitted to cloud providers for processing
- Review provider privacy policies and DPAs
- For complete data privacy, use `local_only` configuration

### 2. Asterisk Integration

**ARI Credentials**:
- Requires Asterisk ARI username/password
- Use dedicated ARI user (not `admin`)
- Grant only necessary permissions
- Example `/etc/asterisk/ari.conf`:
  ```ini
  [AIAgent]
  type=user
  read_only=no
  password=strong_random_password_here
  ```

### 3. Audio File Storage

**Local Hybrid Configuration**:
- Audio files stored in `/mnt/asterisk_media/ai-generated/`
- Contains TTS audio (may include sensitive information)
- Recommendations:
  - Set appropriate filesystem permissions (750)
  - Configure file retention policy
  - Encrypt volume if required by compliance

---

## Compliance

### HIPAA (Healthcare)

If processing Protected Health Information (PHI):
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Encrypt audio files at rest
- [ ] Sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with AI providers
- [ ] Implement access controls
- [ ] Configure log retention per requirements

### GDPR (EU Personal Data)

If processing EU personal data:
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Provide data deletion procedures
- [ ] Document data processing activities
- [ ] Obtain necessary consents
- [ ] Review AI provider GDPR compliance
