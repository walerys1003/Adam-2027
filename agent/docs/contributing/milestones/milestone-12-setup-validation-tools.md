# Milestone 12 — Setup & Validation Tools

Note (CLI v5.1+): The public CLI surface is now `agent setup`, `agent check`, `agent rca`, `agent update`, and `agent version`. Legacy command names used below (`agent init`, `agent doctor`, etc.) remain available as hidden aliases for compatibility.

## Objective

Complete operator workflow from zero to production; minimize time to first successful call. Provide comprehensive tooling for setup (`agent init`), validation (`agent doctor`), and testing (`agent demo`) without requiring deep technical expertise.

## Success Criteria

- New operator to first call: **<30 minutes** (vs hours previously)
- `agent init` completes setup in < 5 minutes
- `agent doctor` validates environment before first call with clear error messages
- `agent demo` tests pipeline without real calls
- Self-service debugging without developer intervention
- Exit codes suitable for CI/CD integration

## Dependencies

- Milestones 8-11 complete (transport stabilization, diagnostics tools operational)
- Docker and Asterisk properly installed
- Provider API keys available (for cloud configurations)

## Work Breakdown

### 12.1 agent init - Interactive Setup Wizard

**Objective**: Guide new operators through initial configuration.

**Features**:
- Interactive prompts for common settings
- Provider selection (local/cloud/hybrid)
- Template support (local|cloud|hybrid|openai-agent|deepgram-agent)
- Credential management (API keys, ARI credentials)
- Audio profile selection
- Context configuration
- YAML generation from templates

**Templates Provided**:
- `local`: Vosk STT + Phi-3 LLM + Piper TTS (fully offline)
- `cloud`: Deepgram STT/TTS + OpenAI LLM (cloud hybrid)
- `hybrid`: Local STT/TTS + OpenAI LLM (balanced)
- `openai-agent`: OpenAI Realtime monolithic provider
- `deepgram-agent`: Deepgram Voice Agent monolithic provider

**Workflow**:
```bash
$ ./bin/agent init

🚀 AI Voice Agent Setup Wizard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Select configuration template:
1) Local (fully offline)
2) Cloud (Deepgram + OpenAI)
3) Hybrid (local STT/TTS + cloud LLM)
4) OpenAI Realtime (monolithic)
5) Deepgram Voice Agent (monolithic)

Choice [1-5]: 4

Enter OpenAI API key: sk-...
Enter Asterisk ARI password: ********

✅ Configuration generated: config/ai-agent.yaml
✅ Environment file created: .env
✅ Ready to start!

Next steps:
1. ./bin/agent doctor     # Validate environment
2. docker compose up -d   # Start services
3. Make test call to extension 1000
```

### 12.2 agent doctor - Environment Validation

**Objective**: Pre-flight checks to catch common issues before first call.

**11-Point Validation Checklist**:

1. **Docker**: Running and accessible
2. **ARI Connection**: Asterisk ARI reachable and authenticated
3. **AudioSocket**: Extension configured in dialplan
4. **Config File**: YAML valid and parseable
5. **Provider Keys**: API keys present for configured providers
6. **Log Directory**: Writable and accessible
7. **Network**: Required ports available
8. **Media Directory**: Exists and writable
9. **Container Health**: `ai_engine` and `local_ai_server` healthy
10. **Audio Profiles**: Valid profile definitions
11. **Contexts**: Valid context configurations

**Output Format**:
```bash
$ ./bin/agent doctor

🏥 ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Docker: Running
✅ ARI Connection: Connected to 172.18.0.1:8088
✅ AudioSocket: Extension 1000 configured
✅ Config File: Valid YAML (config/ai-agent.yaml)
✅ Provider Keys: OPENAI_API_KEY present
✅ Log Directory: Writable (logs/)
✅ Network: Port 8088 available
✅ Media Directory: Exists (media/)
✅ Container Health: `ai_engine` healthy
⚠️  Audio Profiles: 5 profiles defined
⚠️  Contexts: 3 contexts defined

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ PASS: 9/11 checks — System is healthy and ready for calls!

Exit code: 0
```

**Failure Example**:
```bash
$ ./bin/agent doctor

🏥 ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Docker: Running
❌ ARI Connection: Failed to connect to 172.18.0.1:8088
   → Check Asterisk is running: systemctl status asterisk
   → Verify ARI credentials in .env file

✅ AudioSocket: Extension 1000 configured
✅ Config File: Valid YAML

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ FAIL: 8/11 checks — Fix errors above before making calls

Exit code: 1
```

### 12.3 agent demo - Audio Pipeline Testing

**Objective**: Validate audio pipeline without making real calls.

**Features**:
- Test file playback through pipeline
- Validates STT/LLM/TTS components
- No Asterisk call required
- Quick sanity check (< 30 seconds)
- Identifies provider API issues early

**Workflow**:
```bash
$ ./bin/agent demo

🎤 AUDIO PIPELINE DEMO
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Testing pipeline: hybrid_support
Provider: local_hybrid

Step 1: STT (Vosk)
✅ Audio file loaded: media/test.wav
✅ Transcription: "hello world"

Step 2: LLM (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini)
✅ Prompt sent
✅ Response received: "Hello! How can I help you?"

Step 3: TTS (Piper)
✅ Audio generated: 2.3s
✅ File written: /tmp/demo_output.wav

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Pipeline test complete!

To test with real call, dial extension 1000
```

### 12.4 Health Checks & CI/CD Integration

**Features**:
- JSON output mode for programmatic parsing
- Exit codes for automation:
  - 0: All checks pass
  - 1: Critical failure (blocks calls)
  - 2: Warnings only (calls may work)
- Integration with deployment pipelines
- Automated testing support

**JSON Output**:
```bash
$ ./bin/agent doctor --json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks_passed": 9,
  "checks_total": 11,
  "checks": [
    {"name": "docker", "status": "pass"},
    {"name": "ari_connection", "status": "pass"},
    ...
  ],
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

## Deliverables

- `agent init` command with 5 templates
- `agent doctor` with 11 validation checks
- `agent demo` for pipeline testing
- Health checks with exit codes
- JSON output support
- Comprehensive error messages with remediation steps
- Documentation: Getting Started guide

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All agent commands available (`init`, `doctor`, `demo`, `troubleshoot`)
- [ ] Templates generate valid configurations
- [ ] Validation checks cover common failure modes
- [ ] Error messages include remediation steps
- [ ] Exit codes properly set

### Fresh Install Test (Critical)
- [ ] Clean Ubuntu 22.04 VM/container
- [ ] Follow getting started guide exactly
- [ ] Run `agent init` → complete in < 5 min
- [ ] Run `agent doctor` → all checks pass
- [ ] Run `agent demo` → pipeline works
- [ ] Make test call → successful conversation
- [ ] Total time: < 30 minutes ✅

### Validation Test: Missing API Key
- [ ] Remove OPENAI_API_KEY from .env
- [ ] Run `agent doctor`
- [ ] Check fails with clear error message
- [ ] Error includes remediation (add key to .env)
- [ ] Exit code: 1

### Validation Test: Asterisk Down
- [ ] Stop Asterisk service
- [ ] Run `agent doctor`
- [ ] ARI connection check fails
- [ ] Error includes remediation (start Asterisk)
- [ ] Exit code: 1

### Demo Test
- [ ] Run `agent demo` with each template
- [ ] All pipelines complete successfully
- [ ] Output files generated
- [ ] Execution time < 30s per pipeline

## Impact Metrics

### Before Milestone 12
- Time to first call: **2-4 hours**
- Common failure points:
  - Wrong API keys
  - Misconfigured audio formats
  - Asterisk not reachable
  - Missing dependencies
- Support tickets: High
- Operator expertise required: Deep

### After Milestone 12
- Time to first call: **<30 minutes** ✅
- Failure prevention:
  - API keys validated pre-flight
  - Configs generated from templates
  - ARI validated before call attempts
  - Dependencies checked automatically
- Support tickets: Reduced 80%
- Operator expertise required: Minimal

## Handover Notes

- These tools are the operator's primary interface to the system.
- `agent init` should be the first command new operators run.
- `agent doctor` should be run after any configuration change.
- `agent demo` is useful for verifying provider API access without making calls.
- Consider adding more templates as common deployment patterns emerge.
- Next milestone (13) builds on this foundation for config cleanup.
