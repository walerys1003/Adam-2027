# Milestone 22: Outbound Campaign Dialer (Scheduled Calls + Voicemail Drop)

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress (dev validated)  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2–3 weeks (MVP)  
**Branch**: `feature/outbound-campaign-dialer`  

## Summary

Add a **simple, AI-native outbound campaign dialer** to Asterisk AI Voice Agent:

- Campaign-level scheduling (time windows in campaign timezone)
- Pacing + concurrency (target 1–5 concurrent outbound calls)
- Voicemail detection via **Asterisk `AMD()`**
- Voicemail drop via **pre-generated telephony audio** (μ-law 8 kHz)
- HUMAN calls attach to the existing AI call lifecycle and use tools enabled by context
- Operator-first management via Admin UI (Campaigns / Leads / Attempts)

This milestone is designed to be **simpler than Vicidial** while aligning with the project’s ARI-first architecture and existing Admin UI + SQLite patterns.

## Current Status (What Works on Dev)

Validated end-to-end on the development server (single-node, FreePBX-friendly):

- ✅ Admin UI “Call Scheduling” page (Campaigns / Leads / Attempts), sample CSV download, CSV import with `skip_existing`, cancel + recycle.
- ✅ Engine scheduler loop leases leads from SQLite and originates outbound calls with pacing/concurrency.
- ✅ FreePBX routing: originate uses `Local/<number>@from-internal` with extension identity `6789` (PBX/trunk controls final caller ID).
- ✅ Dialplan-assisted AMD via `[aava-outbound-amd]` in `extensions_custom.conf`.
- ✅ HUMAN path attaches AI with the campaign/lead context and honors provider selection from the Context.
- ✅ MACHINE/NOTSURE path leaves voicemail drop media and hangs up.
- ✅ Campaign auto-transitions `running → completed` when the queue is empty and no in-flight/active calls remain.

Validated operator test scenarios (reference):

- ✅ Internal extension lead (e.g. `2765`): consent prompt plays, AI conversation works, `hangup_call` ends call.
- ✅ Internal extension lead: consent denied (`DTMF=2`) drops call; UI records `consent_denied`; lead remains recyclable.
- ✅ Internal extension lead: no answer/voicemail path leaves voicemail drop media correctly.
- ✅ E.164 lead (cell): consent prompt plays, AI conversation works, `hangup_call` ends call.

Notable fixes/hardening already applied during validation:

- SQLite WAL/SHM permission hardening so `ai_engine` can write even after Admin UI touches the DB (prevents `sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database`).
- Voicemail media path unified so Asterisk can play uploaded/converted media from `ai-generated/`.
- Dialplan AMD guardrails fixed (`INITIALSILENCE` prefix length) to reduce false voicemail drops.
- Admin UI “Setup Guide” dialplan generator hardened so disabling consent/voicemail never removes required labels (fixes Asterisk `No such label 'human'` / immediate hangup on answer).
- Shipped default consent/voicemail prompt assets in `assets/outbound_prompts/en-US/` and auto-install them into `asterisk_media/ai-generated/` on Admin UI startup (campaign creation auto-defaults to these URIs when enabled).

## Motivation

Inbound call handling is complete and production-validated, but users need **scheduled outbound calling** for:

- follow-ups
- appointment reminders
- small-team outreach

We want robust outcomes and observability without introducing call-center complexity (predictive dialing, agent seats, abandonment control).

## Canonical Design Notes (Architecture Alignment)

The engine is ARI-first and event driven (`src/engine.py:186`). Outbound requires adding a small “control plane” (scheduler + persistence) without impacting the “media plane” (audio transport, VAD, provider sessions).

Key existing primitives to reuse:

- **SessionStore** for per-call state (`src/core/session_store.py:18`)
- **Tool system** initialized at engine boot (`src/engine.py:512`)
- **Media playback** via shared `/mnt/asterisk_media/ai-generated` (`src/core/playback_manager.py:25`)
- **Call history persistence** patterns (SQLite WAL + busy_timeout) (`src/core/call_history.py:186`)

Reference draft (design discussion notes):

- `archived/outbound-calling-implementation.md`

## Scope (MVP)

### Dialing behavior

- Simple scheduled calls from a campaign lead list (no per-lead schedule)
- Concurrency target: 1–5 outbound calls
- Retry automation: **deferred** (log outcomes; UI-based recycling later)
- AMD policy:
  - `HUMAN` → connect AI
  - `MACHINE` or `NOTSURE` → voicemail drop + hangup
  - Guardrails: allow dialplan heuristics to override to HUMAN for some `AMDCAUSE` prefixes to reduce false VM drops

### PBX routing assumption

Outbound routing assumes:

- trunk(s) already registered
- outbound route patterns configured correctly
- outbound permissions/policy applied via “extension identity” `6789` (AMPUSER/callerid semantics); PBX/trunk may rewrite final outbound caller ID

## Architecture (Outbound Flow)

### A) Origination (FreePBX-friendly)

Engine originates an outbound channel via ARI using existing PBX routing:

- `endpoint=Local/<number>@from-internal`
- Set channel vars so the PBX treats it as extension `6789`:
  - `AMPUSER=6789`
  - `CALLERID(num)=6789`
- Originate **into Stasis on answer** (same style as existing ARI originate usage in telephony tools).

### B) AMD hop (dialplan-assisted, `extensions_custom.conf`)

We run AMD using a dedicated context in `extensions_custom.conf`:

```
[aava-outbound-amd]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AAVA Outbound AMD hop)
 same => n,NoOp(Attempt=${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID} Campaign=${AAVA_CAMPAIGN_ID} Lead=${AAVA_LEAD_ID})
 same => n,ExecIf($["${AAVA_AMD_OPTS}" = ""]?Set(AAVA_AMD_OPTS=2000,2000,1000,5000))
 same => n,AMD(${AAVA_AMD_OPTS})
 same => n,NoOp(AMDSTATUS=${AMDSTATUS} AMDCAUSE=${AMDCAUSE})
 ; Guardrails (reduce false VM drop on silent humans / long words)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AMDCAUSE:0:7}" = "TOOLONG"]?human)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AMDCAUSE:0:14}" = "INITIALSILENCE"]?human)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AMDSTATUS}" = "HUMAN"]?human)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AMDSTATUS}" = "NOTSURE"]?machine)
 same => n(machine),GotoIf($["${AAVA_VM_ENABLED}" = "1"]?vm:machine_done)
 same => n(vm),WaitForSilence(1500,3,10)
 same => n(machine_done),Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent,outbound_amd,${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID},MACHINE,${AMDCAUSE},,)
 same => n,Hangup()
 ; HUMAN path: optional consent gate (DTMF captured only for consent)
 same => n(human),GotoIf($["${AAVA_CONSENT_ENABLED}" = "1"]?consent:human_done)
 same => n(consent),Set(TIMEOUT(response)=${IF($["${AAVA_CONSENT_TIMEOUT}"=""]?5:${AAVA_CONSENT_TIMEOUT})})
 same => n,NoOp(AAVA CONSENT enabled=${AAVA_CONSENT_ENABLED} timeout=${AAVA_CONSENT_TIMEOUT} playback=${AAVA_CONSENT_PLAYBACK})
 ; IMPORTANT: Use Read() with a prompt so DTMF is captured while the consent message plays.
 ; If we Playback() then Read(), DTMF pressed during Playback is consumed and Read() times out.
 same => n,Read(AAVA_CONSENT_DTMF,${AAVA_CONSENT_PLAYBACK},1)
 same => n,NoOp(AAVA CONSENT dtmf=${AAVA_CONSENT_DTMF})
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AAVA_CONSENT_DTMF}" = "1"]?human_ok)
 same => n,GotoIf($["${AAVA_CONSENT_DTMF}" = "2"]?human_denied)
 same => n(human_timeout),Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent,outbound_amd,${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID},HUMAN,${AMDCAUSE},,timeout)
 same => n,Hangup()
 same => n(human_denied),Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent,outbound_amd,${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID},HUMAN,${AMDCAUSE},2,denied)
 same => n,Hangup()
 same => n(human_ok),Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent,outbound_amd,${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID},HUMAN,${AMDCAUSE},1,accepted)
 same => n,Hangup()
 same => n(human_done),Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent,outbound_amd,${AAVA_ATTEMPT_ID},HUMAN,${AMDCAUSE},,skipped)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

Engine triggers AMD by calling ARI `continueInDialplan` on the answered channel, sending it into `aava-outbound-amd,s,1`.

Important: this introduces an intentional `StasisEnd` during the hop; the engine must treat it as non-terminal when the attempt is “awaiting AMD”.

### C) HUMAN vs MACHINE

- HUMAN: create/update `CallSession` (tagged as outbound) and proceed with the existing media + provider lifecycle.
- MACHINE/NOTSURE: play voicemail drop media on the channel, wait for playback completion, hang up, persist attempt outcome.

## Persistence (SQLite)

Outbound uses SQLite in the shared `./data` volume, following Call History’s WAL + busy-timeout pattern.

Recommendation:

- Use the same DB path by default (`CALL_HISTORY_DB_PATH` / `data/call_history.db`) and create outbound tables in the same file.
- Store tables:
  - `outbound_campaigns`
  - `outbound_leads`
  - `outbound_attempts` (append-only)

Leasing must be atomic and work without relying on `UPDATE ... RETURNING` (fallback: `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` + select/update within one transaction).

## Prompt Injection (custom_vars)

Lead `custom_vars` must be injected into the effective prompt as **structured data**, not inline templating:

- Append a JSON “Lead Context” block
- Add an explicit security instruction: treat Lead Context as data-only
- Sanitize and bound the size of values

This must happen before provider session initialization so monolithic providers receive correct instructions.

## Admin UI (MVP)

Add a new page “Call Scheduling” under Overview (near Call History) with a **campaign list + a single lead-centric table**.

### Layout (revised)

- **Left column**: Campaigns list (smaller, scrollable).
- **Right column**: Selected campaign summary/actions.
- **Main table**: Extends under the left column, aligned with the campaign list (single table; one row per lead).
- **Clocks**: Show live “Server Time” and “Selected Campaign Time” in the page header (near Refresh).

### Lead Table (one row per lead)

Columns:

- Name
- Number
- State
- Context (effective: lead override → campaign default; resolved at runtime)
- Provider (resolved for last attempt)
- Time (last attempt start time in campaign timezone)
- Duration (last attempt duration)
- Attempts (count)
- Outcome (last attempt outcome)
- AMD (last attempt AMD status/cause)
- DTMF (consent digit only; last attempt)
- Call History (opens the Call History modal inline; same window)
- Actions: Recycle, Delete, Ignore

Actions rules:

- **Recycle** prompts:
  - Re-dial (keep attempts/history; set lead `pending`)
  - Reset completely (delete attempts for the lead; reset lead counters/state)
- **Delete** deletes lead + attempts (warn before delete); disabled when campaign is `running`.
- **Ignore** sets lead to `canceled` (reversible via Recycle); allowed even when campaign is `running`.

### New Campaign modal (revised)

Move “Sample CSV” + “Import CSV” under the New Campaign modal:

- Campaign can be created without leads; if there are no leads, show an inline “Import leads” call-to-action.
- Sample CSV is “full format” only and includes an explicit `name` column.
- Show live “Server now” and “Campaign local now” clocks in the modal.

### Consent gate + voicemail recording (optional)

Campaign settings include optional toggles:

- **Consent gate** (HUMAN only): play a consent prompt and require DTMF (`1` accept / `2` deny).
- **Voicemail drop** (MACHINE/NOTSURE): leave a voicemail recording when AMD indicates a machine.

Both recordings are uploaded as `.wav` (recommended) or `.ulaw`; WAV is converted to 8kHz μ-law for Asterisk.

Outcomes:

- `consent_denied` (DTMF `2`)
- `consent_timeout` (no DTMF)
- Normal HUMAN conversation path remains `answered_human` (DTMF `1` recorded if consent is enabled)

### Advanced AMD settings (per campaign)

Expose AMD tuning under “Advanced” with per-parameter help text (positional AMD args).
Defaults remain Vicidial-style unless overridden.

### Setup Guide

Keep a collapsible “Setup Guide” with dialplan snippet and verification commands.

## Implementation Plan (Phases)

### Phase 1 — Storage + APIs (Foundation)

- Add `OutboundStore` module following `CallHistoryStore` patterns (`src/core/call_history.py:98`)
- Define schema + migrations/init
- Add Admin UI backend router for CRUD + import + stats (mirror `admin_ui/backend/api/calls.py`)

### Phase 2 — Engine scheduler + originate

- Add outbound scheduler background task in `Engine.start()` (`src/engine.py:507`)
- Implement leasing + pacing + concurrency
- Implement originate wrapper + immediate error handling
- Add watchdog timers for “no answer / never returned” attempts

### Phase 3 — AMD hop + Stasis routing

- Implement `appArgs` routing for:
  - `outbound,<attempt_id>`
  - `outbound_amd,<attempt_id>,<status>,<cause>`
- Implement “awaiting AMD” tracking so `StasisEnd` is not terminal during hop
- Apply AMD options (`AAVA_AMD_OPTS`) from campaign config

### Phase 4 — Voicemail drop flow

- Campaign start requires voicemail audio to exist
- Implement TTS generation (`local_ai_server`) + upload support
- Implement WAV preview endpoint for Admin UI
- Play voicemail drop (μ-law 8k) and hang up

### Phase 5 — HUMAN attach to AI

- Create outbound-tagged CallSession and attach transport/provider
- Ensure tools enabled by context are available (tool system already initialized at boot)
- Persist attempt outcome + link to Call History record

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

- Campaign can be created, cloned, started, paused, stopped, and shows accurate stats in Admin UI.
- CSV import supports `skip_existing` default and error CSV output; sample CSV includes `name`.
- Engine dials via Local/from-internal routing as extension `6789`.
- AMD:
  - `HUMAN` calls enter AI and produce a Call History record.
  - `MACHINE/NOTSURE` triggers voicemail drop playback when enabled and results in `voicemail_dropped` (or `machine_detected` when voicemail drop is disabled).
- Consent gate (when enabled):
  - On HUMAN: prompt for DTMF (`1` accept / `2` deny) before AI attaches.
  - Denied/timeout attempts persist outcomes (`consent_denied` / `consent_timeout`) and do not attach AI.
  - DTMF captured for consent only and displayed in the lead table.
- Attempt outcomes are persisted and visible in Attempts tab and exportable.
- Outbound scheduler does not impact inbound call quality (no blocking DB operations on the asyncio loop).

## Testing & Verification (Smoke)

These steps are designed to validate the full outbound loop end-to-end on a typical FreePBX/Asterisk 18+ install.

### 1) Dialplan install (Asterisk / FreePBX)

1. Add the `[aava-outbound-amd]` context to `extensions_custom.conf`.
2. Replace the Stasis app name in the snippet with your configured `asterisk.app_name` (from `config/ai-agent.yaml` / Admin UI).
3. Reload dialplan:
   - `asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"`
4. Verify the context is present:
   - `asterisk -rx "dialplan show aava-outbound-amd"`

Expected: the CLI output includes the `AMD()` step and the `Stasis(...,outbound_amd,...)` line.

### 2) Engine prerequisites

- Confirm `ai_engine` is running and connected to ARI (baseline behavior for inbound).
- If using `voicemail_drop_mode=tts`, confirm `local_ai_server` is running and healthy (per your existing deployment docs).
- After deploying code changes, restart `ai_engine` (outbound provider/context selection relies on originate-time variables).

### 3) Admin UI happy path

1. Open Admin UI and create a campaign:
   - timezone + daily window
   - `max_concurrent` = 1 (first test)
   - optionally enable “Consent gate” and/or “Voicemail drop”
   - upload/generate the required recordings for enabled features
2. Import a small CSV (2–3 leads) from the New Campaign modal (or via the empty-state CTA):
   - one number you can answer (HUMAN path)
   - one number that reliably hits voicemail (MACHINE path)
3. Start the campaign.

Expected:

- Campaign transitions to `running`.
- Leads transition from `pending` to `dialing`.
- Attempts appear in the Attempts tab with timestamps.

### 4) HUMAN call validation

1. Answer the outbound call and speak.
2. If consent gate is enabled, press `1` to accept.
2. Confirm AI engages (greeting + turn-taking).
3. End the call.

Expected:

- Attempt outcome becomes `answered_human` and includes a `call_history_call_id`.
- Call History shows the outbound call record and transcript.

### 5) MACHINE call validation (voicemail drop)

1. Let the call hit voicemail.

Expected:

- Attempt shows `amd_status=MACHINE` or `amd_status=NOTSURE` (treated as machine).
- Voicemail drop plays and then the call hangs up.
- Attempt outcome becomes `voicemail_dropped`.

### 6) Basic resilience checks

- Stop campaign (choose “stop dialing only”) and confirm pending leads remain `pending`.
- Stop campaign (choose “stop and cancel pending”) and confirm pending leads become `canceled`.
- While an outbound campaign is running, place an inbound test call and confirm inbound audio quality is unaffected.

### 7) Additional sanity checks (recommended)

- Consent timeout: enable consent gate, answer, press nothing → expect `consent_timeout` and hangup.
- Consent denied: enable consent gate, answer, press `2` → expect `consent_denied`, hangup, lead remains recyclable.
- Consent disabled: disable consent gate, answer → expect immediate AI attach.
- Voicemail drop disabled: disable voicemail drop, let call hit voicemail → expect `machine_detected` (no playback), hangup.
- Campaign pacing:
  - set `max_concurrent=2` and `min_interval=5s` with 4+ internal-extension leads
  - confirm at most 2 calls are “in progress” and origination does not exceed min interval.
- Campaign window/timezone:
  - set a window that is currently outside local time → status card should show “Outside window” and no calls originate.
  - set a window that crosses midnight → confirm “within” logic behaves as expected.
- Restart resilience: restart `ai_engine` mid-campaign and confirm:
  - stale `leased`/`dialing` leads are re-queued after TTL
  - campaign resumes dialing if still `running` and within window.

### 8) Automated tests

- Run `pytest -q` and confirm green before shipping changes.

## Operational Notes (Dev)

Common “out of the box” gotchas:

- SQLite permissions: when multiple containers touch the same SQLite DB, ensure `call_history.db`, `call_history.db-wal`, and `call_history.db-shm` remain writable by the `ai_engine` user/group.
- Voicemail media visibility: Asterisk must be able to resolve the uploaded/converted μ-law file under `ai-generated/` via its `sounds` path (symlink or bind mount).
- Dialplan changes require a reload: `asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"`.

## Observability

Minimum:

- Structured logs include `campaign_id`, `lead_id`, `attempt_id`, `ari_channel_id` when known.

Optional (post-MVP):

- Prometheus metrics:
  - `aava_outbound_calls_total{campaign_id,outcome}`
  - `aava_outbound_active_calls{campaign_id}`
  - `aava_outbound_amd_duration_seconds`
  - `aava_outbound_pending_leads{campaign_id}`

## Audit Alignment (What We Take vs What We Don’t)

The archived audit report (`archived/Outbound - Asterisk AI Voice Agent Audit.md`) is written for an **enterprise outbound platform** (Vicidial/Genesys/Connect style). This milestone intentionally targets a **single-node, simpler-than-Vicidial** implementation.

### Lessons we take (aligns with this milestone)

- Outbound requires a proactive “pacer” loop (control plane) that is decoupled from the media plane.
- Originations must be treated as *distributed state transitions* (originate → answer → AMD → AI attach) with persistent attempt tracking and crash recovery.
- AMD in dialplan is the pragmatic way to avoid wasting AI sessions on machines; `NOTSURE` should be treated as `MACHINE` (cost control).
- Outcomes must be first-class: classify originate failures and call progress (busy/noanswer/congestion/chanunavail) so operators can recycle leads safely.
- Operator UX matters: start/pause/stop, queue visibility, and link attempts to call history for debugging.
- Compliance-lite is still necessary even for MVP: campaign time windows + (future) a DNC mechanism.

### Lessons we defer (valuable, but not MVP)

- DNC workflows:
  - manual DNC import/scrub
  - “stop calling me” intent → add to DNC automatically via a tool
- Retry automation (policy-based backoff by outcome) and lead hygiene automation.
  - Future “minimal automation”: `max_attempts` + backoff for `busy`/`no_answer` only (manual remains v1).
- Rate limiting beyond min-interval pacing (calls-per-second burst control, trunk protection), plus circuit breakers (auto-pause on repeated originate failures).
- Real-time dashboards (WebSocket push) and richer analytics (ASR/AHT/abandonment-style metrics).
- Multi-campaign pacing fairness, list mixing/priority, and multi-list assignment.

### Lessons we explicitly do not adopt (conflicts with project constraints)

- Predictive dialing, abandonment-rate control, agent seats, and call-center “hopper” semantics.
- Mandatory microservices split (Orchestrator + Pacer + Redis + PostgreSQL) for the MVP path.
  - We keep module boundaries clean so a future contributor can extract services later, but we do not introduce that operational complexity now.

## Improvement Plan (Post-MVP Hardening Backlog)

These are concrete follow-ups that preserve the single-node architecture while addressing the most useful “enterprise” lessons.

### Phase 6 — Outcome classification + resilience

- Map ARI originate HTTP errors to attempt outcomes (4xx vs 5xx) and ensure a failed originate immediately releases the lease.
- Enrich “call progress” outcomes using hangup cause / ARI events (busy/noanswer/congestion/chanunavail/canceled) and persist `error_message` for operator review.
- Add a simple circuit breaker per campaign: auto-pause after N consecutive `error` outcomes within a time window.
- Add watchdog cleanup on engine boot: requeue stale `leased`/`dialing` leads past TTL (already supported via `leased_until_utc`, ensure periodic cleanup is scheduled too).

### Phase 7 — Compliance-lite + operator controls

- Add `outbound_dnc` table(s) (SQLite) with **per-campaign** DNC plus an optional **global** DNC list (campaigns default to scrubbing against global + their own).
- Scrub during import + leasing (config-gated), and support importing into global vs campaign scope.
- Add a minimal “DNC this number” action in Call History + lead row action in Call Scheduling UI (choose campaign scope; global is the default).
- Add a dialplan-safe caller ID policy doc (we assume PBX routes/rewrites final outbound caller ID; the dialer sets extension identity only).

### Phase 8 — Observability + export

- Expose outbound Prometheus metrics (optional) and add a small “Outbound Health” panel in Admin UI.
- Add CSV export endpoints for leads and attempts (campaign scoped).
