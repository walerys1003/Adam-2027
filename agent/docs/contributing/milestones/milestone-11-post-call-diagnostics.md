# Milestone 11 — Post-Call Diagnostics & Troubleshooting

Note (CLI v5.1+): The public CLI surface is now `agent setup`, `agent check`, `agent rca`, `agent update`, and `agent version`. Legacy command names used below (`agent troubleshoot`, etc.) remain available as hidden aliases for compatibility.

## Objective

Automated post-call RCA (root cause analysis) with AI-powered diagnosis matching manual analysis quality. Provide operators with instant, actionable insights without deep technical expertise required.

## Success Criteria

- Accurate call detection (filters AudioSocket infrastructure channels automatically)
- RCA-level metrics depth matches manual analysis quality
- AI diagnosis provides actionable fixes with configuration examples
- Quality scoring (0-100) with EXCELLENT/FAIR/POOR/CRITICAL verdicts aligns with user experience
- `agent troubleshoot` command completes analysis in < 10 seconds

## Dependencies

- Milestones 8-10 complete (golden baselines established, transport orchestrator operational)
- Docker container logs accessible
- OpenAI or Anthropic API access for AI-powered diagnosis

## Work Breakdown

### 11.1 agent troubleshoot CLI Command

**Objective**: Single command for instant post-call analysis.

**Usage**:
```bash
./bin/agent troubleshoot --last              # Analyze most recent call
./bin/agent troubleshoot --call 1761523231.2199
./bin/agent troubleshoot --last --provider anthropic
./bin/agent troubleshoot --last --no-llm     # Skip AI diagnosis
```

**Implementation** (`bin/agent`):
- Add `troubleshoot` subcommand to agent CLI
- Support call ID or `--last` flag
- Optional AI provider selection (openai/anthropic/none)
- JSON and text output formats
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

### 11.2 RCA-Level Metrics Extraction

**Objective**: Extract comprehensive call metrics from Docker logs.

**Key Metrics**:
- **Audio Quality**: SNR, drift percentage, underflow counts
- **Provider Alignment**: Provider bytes, received bytes, ratio
- **Transport**: Wire format, provider formats, sampling rates
- **Timing**: Wall seconds, content duration, call duration
- **VAD**: Gating events, buffered chunks, interrupt detection
- **Errors**: Format mismatches, codec warnings, API errors

**Log Parsing**:
- Filter by call ID (e.g., `1761523231.2199`)
- Extract structured data from log lines
- Calculate derived metrics (drift %, bytes ratio)
- Detect format alignment issues
- Parse TransportCard for format visibility

### 11.3 Golden Baseline Comparison

**Reference Baselines**:
- **OpenAI Realtime**: SNR 64.7 dB, 0 underflows, 0 buffered chunks
- **Deepgram Voice Agent**: SNR 66.8 dB, 0 underflows, ratio 1.0
- **Streaming Performance**: <2 restarts per turn, jitter < 100ms

**Comparison Logic**:
- Calculate delta from golden baseline
- Flag significant deviations (>10% variance)
- Identify performance regressions
- Suggest configuration adjustments

### 11.4 Format/Sampling Alignment Detection

**Objective**: Catch AudioSocket format mismatches automatically.

**Checks**:
- Wire format vs YAML configuration
- Provider input format vs wire format
- Sample rate consistency across pipeline
- Encoding compatibility (slin, mulaw, alaw, pcm16)
- Frame size alignment (160 bytes for 8kHz, 320 for 16kHz)

**Detection**:
- Parse TransportCard from logs
- Compare declared vs actual formats
- Identify resampling/encoding overhead
- Flag unnecessary transcoding

### 11.5 AI-Powered Diagnosis

**Objective**: Context-aware diagnosis with actionable fixes.

**Features**:
- Natural language problem description
- Root cause identification
- Configuration recommendations with examples
- Filters benign warnings (e.g., ARI 404s during codec detection)
- Provider-specific guidance

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Include golden baseline context
- Provide call metrics summary
- Request specific YAML fixes
- Ask for confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Prioritize actionable recommendations

**Example Output**:
```
DIAGNOSIS (HIGH confidence):
The call shows perfect audio metrics (SNR 67.3 dB) but excessive ARI 
variable read failures. These 404 errors are BENIGN - they occur during 
codec detection and don't affect call quality.

RECOMMENDATION:
No action needed. Audio quality is EXCELLENT.
```

### 11.6 Quality Scoring System

**Score Calculation** (0-100):
- SNR score (40 points): ≥65 dB = 40, <50 dB = 0
- Drift score (20 points): <5% = 20, >20% = 0
- Underflow score (20 points): 0 = 20, >10 = 0
- Provider alignment (20 points): ratio 0.95-1.05 = 20

**Verdict Mapping**:
- 90-100: EXCELLENT
- 75-89: GOOD
- 50-74: FAIR
- 25-49: POOR
- 0-24: CRITICAL

**Greeting Segment Awareness**:
- Exclude first ~500ms from quality calculations
- Greeting timing artifacts don't affect score
- Focus on conversational segments

## Deliverables

- `agent troubleshoot` CLI command fully functional
- RCA metrics extraction from Docker logs
- Golden baseline comparison logic
- Format alignment detection
- AI-powered diagnosis (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Quality scoring with verdicts
