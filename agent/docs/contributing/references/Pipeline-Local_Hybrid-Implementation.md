```

**Validation:**

## Test Execution Order

### Phase 1: Individual Tool Testing
Test each tool in isolation to verify basic functionality.

1. ✅ **hangup_call** - Already validated
2. ✅ **send_email_summary** - Already validated
3. 🔲 **transfer** - Test basic transfer
4. 🔲 **leave_voicemail** - Test voicemail transfer
5. 🔲 **request_transcript** - Test email extraction
6. 🔲 **cancel_transfer** - Test transfer cancellation

### Phase 2: Combined Scenarios
Test realistic workflows combining multiple tools.

**Scenario 1: Transfer + Cancel**
```
1. Request transfer to extension
2. Cancel while ringing
3. Continue conversation
4. Hangup
```

**Scenario 2: Full Conversation + Email**
```
1. Have conversation
2. Request transcript to email
3. Provide email address
4. Hangup normally
5. Verify both emails received (summary + transcript)
```

**Scenario 3: Voicemail Flow**
```
1. Ask to leave voicemail
2. Transfer to voicemail
3. Leave message
4. Verify voicemail saved
```

## Known Limitations

1. **request_transcript** requires accurate email extraction from speech
   - May fail if email address not clearly spoken
   - STT errors on email addresses are common

2. **cancel_transfer** only works during ringing phase
   - Cannot cancel after answer
   - Requires transfer to be in progress

3. **leave_voicemail** requires Asterisk voicemail configuration
   - Must have valid voicemail mailbox
   - Dialplan must route to voicemail app

4. **transfer** requires valid destination
   - Extension must exist
   - Or external number must be permitted by trunk
