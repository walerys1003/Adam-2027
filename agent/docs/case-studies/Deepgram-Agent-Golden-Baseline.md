## Test Call Transcript (v4.3.0)

```text
AI: Hi CALLER NAME, I'm Ava with the Deepgram voice demo. 
    Ask me anything about the Asterisk AI Voice Agent project.

Caller: Tell me about the latency of this project.

AI: The Deepgram Voice Agent typically has a response time of 1 to 2 seconds, 
    making it suitable for real-time interactions.

AI: This low latency is achieved by integrating speech-to-text, reasoning, 
    and text-to-speech in a single WebSocket connection.

Caller: Okay. Can you email me the transcript of this conversation?

AI: Please provide your email address, and I will send you the transcript.

Caller: My email is caller at example dot com.

AI: I have h-e-a-t-h-e-r-k-h-a-l-i-l at hotmail dot com. Is that correct?

Caller: No. It's c a l l e r at hot mail dot com.

AI: I have c-a-l-l-e-r at hotmail dot com. Is that correct?

Caller: That is correct. Yes.

AI: Perfect! I'll send the complete transcript to caller at example dot com 
    when our call ends.

[Tool calls executed:]
- request_transcript (saved for end-of-call sending)
- hangup_call (clean termination)

[Call ends cleanly with transcript and summary sent successfully]

## Technical Architecture

### Audio Flow

```
Asterisk (μ-law 8kHz) 
    ↓ RTP
AI Engine
    ↓ μ-law 8kHz (passthrough)
Deepgram Voice Agent API
    ↓ Process with integrated pipeline
Deepgram Voice Agent API
    ↓ Generate μ-law 8kHz
    ↓ RTP
Asterisk
```

### Key Components

1. **Provider**: `src/providers/deepgram.py`
   - WebSocket connection to Deepgram Agent API
   - Bidirectional streaming
   - Function calling via Deepgram format
   - Conversation tracking and transcription

2. **Tool Adapter**: `src/tools/adapters/deepgram.py`
   - Formats tools for Deepgram API (`functions` field)
   - Handles async tool execution
   - Sends function results back to Deepgram

3. **Audio Processing**: Native format support
   - Input: μ-law 8kHz (direct passthrough)
   - Output: μ-law 8kHz (native Asterisk format)
   - No resampling required for optimal quality

4. **Conversation Tracking**: Integrated transcription
   - `ConversationText` events capture user and assistant messages
   - Full conversation history saved to session
   - Enables email summaries and transcripts

## Key Features Validated

### ✅ Full Agent Integration

- **STT + LLM + TTS**: Single WebSocket connection for all components
- **Integrated Pipeline**: Speech-to-text, reasoning, and text-to-speech unified
- **No Component Management**: Simplified architecture vs pipeline mode
- **Lower Latency**: Direct integration reduces roundtrip delays

### ✅ Function Calling

- **Tool Execution**: Successfully executed `request_transcript` and `hangup_call`
- **Context Preserved**: AI maintained conversation context during tool calls
- **Async Handling**: Tool execution didn't block conversation flow
- **Response Integration**: Tool results seamlessly integrated into responses

### ✅ Conversation Tracking

- **Message Capture**: All user and assistant messages tracked via `ConversationText` events
- **Session Storage**: Full conversation history saved to session store
- **Email Integration**: Complete transcript available for email delivery
- **Validation**: ✅ Tracked conversation message logs confirm functionality

### ✅ Email Delivery

- **Summary Email**: Sent successfully with call metadata
- **Transcript Email**: Sent to user-provided email (caller@example.com)
- **End-of-Call Timing**: Both emails sent during call cleanup
- **Complete History**: Full conversation included in both emails

### ✅ Tool Configuration

- **6/6 Tools Configured**: All context tools properly sent to Deepgram API
- **Function Format**: Using `functions` field (not `tools` like OpenAI)
- **FunctionCallRequest Events**: Properly received and handled
- **Tool Results**: Successfully sent back to Deepgram via `FunctionCallResponse`

## Lessons Learned & Critical Fixes

### 1. Function Calling Field Name (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Using wrong field name for tool configuration.

**Fix**: Use `functions` field for Deepgram (not `tools` like OpenAI).

```python
# ❌ WRONG - OpenAI format
settings["agent"]["think"]["tools"] = functions

# ✅ CORRECT - Deepgram format
settings["agent"]["think"]["functions"] = functions
```

**Learning**: Deepgram uses `functions` field while OpenAI uses `tools` field.

### 2. FunctionCallRequest Event Type (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Not handling Deepgram's function call events correctly.

**Fix**: Listen for `FunctionCallRequest` event type.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Generic function_call
elif et == "function_call":

# ✅ CORRECT - Deepgram-specific event
elif et == "FunctionCallRequest":
```

**Learning**: Each provider has its own event type nomenclature.

### 3. Conversation Tracking Implementation

**Issue**: Early implementations didn't track conversation history.

**Fix**: Handle `ConversationText` events and save to session store.

```python
# Extract text from ConversationText event
text = data.get("text", "")
role = data.get("role", "assistant")

# Save to session for email delivery
await self._track_conversation_message(role, text)
```

**Validation** (call 1763411551.5763):

- ✅ Conversation tracking logs show successful message capture
- ✅ Email summary contained full conversation history
- ✅ Transcript email sent with complete conversation

**Learning**: Deepgram's `ConversationText` events provide clean message boundaries.

### 4. Tool Adapter Initialization Timing

**Issue**: Tool adapter created too late for proper dependency injection.

**Fix**: Initialize `_tool_adapter` in `__init__` (not during session start).

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - Early initialization in __init__
def __init__(self, ...):
    from src.tools.registry import tool_registry
    self._tool_adapter = DeepgramToolAdapter(tool_registry)
```

**Impact**: Engine can inject `_session_store` before session starts, enabling conversation tracking.

### 5. Context-Filtered Tool Lists

**Issue**: Originally sent ALL tools from registry instead of context-specific tools.

**Fix**: Use context-provided tool list for filtering.

```python
# Get tools from context (filtered by engine)
tool_names = context.get('tools', []) if context else []

# Format only the specified tools
functions = self._tool_adapter.format_tools(tool_names)
```

**Validation** (call 1763411551.5763):

- ✅ 6 tools configured (exactly what's in context)
- ✅ `functions=['transfer', 'cancel_transfer', 'hangup_call', 'leave_voicemail', 'send_email_summary', 'request_transcript']`

**Learning**: Always respect context-level tool configuration for proper access control.
