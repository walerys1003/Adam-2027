[Call ends cleanly with transcript sent successfully to email]
```

### v4.2.0 Transcript (Previous Baseline)

```text
AI: Hi CALLER NAME, I'm Ava demonstrating Google Gemini Live API! 
    I can tell you all about the Asterisk AI Voice Agent project - 
    ask me anything about how it works, setup, or features. Try 
    interrupting me anytime!

Caller: Tell me about the latency of this project.

AI: The Google Gemini Live configuration is incredibly fast, with 
    latency of less than one second. This is because it uses native 
    audio processing and true duplex communication.

Caller: Please send me transcript of this conversation at 
        caller@example.com.

AI: Certainly. I can send a transcript to caller@example.com. 
    Is that correct?

Caller: That is correct.

AI: Perfect! I'll send the complete transcript to caller@example.com 
    when our call ends.

[Call ends cleanly with transcript sent successfully]

## Technical Architecture

### Audio Flow

```
Asterisk (μ-law 8kHz) 
    ↓ RTP
AI Engine
    ↓ Resample to PCM16 16kHz
Google Gemini Live API
    ↓ Process with native audio
Google Gemini Live API
    ↓ Generate PCM16 24kHz
AI Engine
    ↓ Resample to μ-law 8kHz
    ↓ RTP
Asterisk
```

### Key Components

1. **Provider**: `src/providers/google_live.py`
   - WebSocket connection to Gemini Live API
   - Bidirectional streaming
   - Native audio processing
   - Tool execution via Google function declarations

2. **Tool Adapter**: `src/tools/adapters/google.py`
   - Formats tools for Google API
   - Handles async tool execution
   - Sends tool responses back to Gemini

3. **Audio Processing**: Built-in resampling
   - Input: 8kHz → 16kHz for Gemini
   - Output: 24kHz → 8kHz for Asterisk

4. **Transcription**: Dual transcription system
   - `inputTranscription`: User speech
   - `outputTranscription`: AI speech
   - Saved on `turnComplete` flag

## Key Features Validated

### ✅ True Duplex Communication

- **Barge-in**: Users can interrupt AI at any time
- **Natural Flow**: Conversation feels like talking to a human
- **No Turn-Taking**: No rigid back-and-forth structure
- **Instant Response**: AI responds immediately to interruptions

### ✅ Ultra-Low Latency

- **<1 second response time** from speech end to audio start
- **Native audio processing** eliminates STT→LLM→TTS pipeline delays
- **WebSocket streaming** provides continuous bidirectional data flow
- **No buffering delays** with immediate audio transmission

### ✅ Function Calling in Streaming Mode

- **Tool execution**: Successfully executed `request_transcript` tool
- **Context preserved**: AI maintained conversation context during tool call
- **Async handling**: Tool execution didn't block conversation flow
- **Response integration**: Tool results seamlessly integrated into response

### ✅ Session Management

- **Context retention**: AI remembered entire conversation history
- **State management**: Session state properly maintained
- **Cleanup handling**: Clean session cleanup on call end

### ✅ Complete Transcription

- **Input transcription**: User speech captured accurately
- **Output transcription**: AI speech transcribed correctly
- **Turn completion**: Transcriptions saved on `turnComplete` flag
- **Email delivery**: Complete transcript sent at call end

## Lessons Learned & Critical Fixes

### 1. Transcription Handling (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Initial implementation used heuristics (punctuation, timing) to detect end of utterance.

**Fix**: Use `turnComplete` flag from API instead of heuristics.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Don't use heuristics
if text.endswith(('.', '?', '!')) or time_since_last > threshold:
    save_transcription()

# ✅ CORRECT - Use turnComplete flag
if server_content.get('turnComplete'):
    save_transcription()
```

**Learning**: Trust the API's turn completion signals rather than implementing custom heuristics.

### 2. Incremental Transcription Fragments (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: API sends incremental word-by-word fragments, not cumulative text.

**Fix**: Concatenate fragments until `turnComplete`.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Replacing buffer
self.buffer = transcription.get('text', '')

# ✅ CORRECT - Concatenating fragments
self.buffer += transcription.get('text', '')
```

**Learning**: API behavior differs from documentation - always validate with real testing.

### 3. Greeting Implementation

**Issue**: Cannot pre-fill model response in `clientContent`.

**Fix**: Send user turn asking model to speak greeting.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Pre-filled model response
{"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Hello!"}]}

# ✅ CORRECT - User turn requesting greeting
{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Please greet the caller..."}]}
```

**Learning**: Gemini Live API requires user turns to trigger model speech.

### 4. Transcript Email Timing (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: `request_transcript` tool sent email immediately (mid-call), missing final conversation.

**Fix**: Store email in session, send at call cleanup with complete history.

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Send immediately
asyncio.create_task(send_email())

# ✅ CORRECT - Store for later
session.transcript_emails.add(email)
# Send in engine cleanup with complete conversation
```

**Learning**: Defer transcript sending until call end for completeness.

### 5. Call Ending Protocol

**Issue**: AI completed task but didn't hang up call, leaving silence.

**Fix**: Explicit call ending protocol in system prompt.

```yaml
CALL ENDING PROTOCOL (CRITICAL):
1. When user indicates they're done → ask "anything else?"
2. If user confirms done → say farewell + IMMEDIATELY call hangup_call
3. NEVER leave call hanging in silence
4. After completing ANY task → ask if there's anything else
```

**Learning**: Be explicit about when and how to end calls in system prompts.

### 6. Configurable Parameters

**Issue**: Many parameters were hardcoded, limiting user flexibility.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive YAML configuration for all parameters.

**New Config Options**:

- LLM generation parameters (temperature, max_tokens, top_p, top_k)
- Response modalities (audio, text, audio_text)
- Transcription toggles (enable_input, enable_output)

**Learning**: Provide maximum user flexibility via configuration without code changes.

### 7. Tool Filtering and Conversation Tracking (CRITICAL, 2025-11-17)

**Context**: After config cleanup deployment, Google Live agent only had 1 tool instead of 6, and email summaries were empty despite transcriptions being captured.

**Root Cause Discovery**:

**Bug #1 - Tool Filtering**:

- `GoogleLiveProvider._send_setup()` called `get_tools_config()` which returned ALL tools from registry
- Should have used context-filtered tool list like OpenAI and Deepgram providers
- Result: Setup message sent only 1 tool wrapper to API instead of 6 individual tools

**Bug #2 - Conversation Tracking**:

- Engine only injects `_session_store` if `hasattr(provider, '_tool_adapter')` is true
- `_tool_adapter` was created inside `_send_setup()` (called during `start_session()`)
- Engine checks `hasattr(_tool_adapter)` BEFORE calling `start_session()`
- Result: `_session_store` was never injected, transcriptions couldn't be saved to session

**Fix**:

```python
# WRONG - Create adapter during session start (too late for injection)
async def _send_setup(self, context):
    self._tool_adapter = GoogleToolAdapter(tool_registry)
    tools = self._tool_adapter.get_tools_config()  # Returns ALL tools

# CORRECT - Create adapter in __init__, use context filtering
def __init__(self, ...):
    from src.tools.registry import tool_registry
    self._tool_adapter = GoogleToolAdapter(tool_registry)  # Early creation

async def _send_setup(self, context):
    tool_names = context.get('tools', [])  # Get filtered list
    tools = self._tool_adapter.format_tools(tool_names)  # Only context tools
```

**Validation** (call 1763410994.5759):

- ✅ 6 tools configured and sent to API
- ✅ `_session_store` injected before session start
- ✅ Conversation messages tracked: "✅ Tracked conversation message"
- ✅ Email summary contained full conversation history
- ✅ request_transcript tool executed successfully

**Learning**:

- Tool adapters must be created in `__init__` for proper dependency injection
- Always use context-filtered tool lists, not registry-wide exports
- Timing of initialization matters for engine dependency injection

**Deployment**: Commit `6eaa315`, November 17, 2025

### 8. Google Live realtimeInputConfig (CRITICAL, 2025-11-16 RCA)

**Context**: After this baseline was established (commit `d4affe8`), later experiments introduced an explicit `realtimeInputConfig` block in `GoogleLiveProvider._send_setup`:

```json
"realtimeInputConfig": {
  "automaticActivityDetection": {
    "disabled": false
  }
}
```

On clean telephony audio (8 kHz µ-law → 16 kHz PCM, SNR ~60–70 dB) this change caused **severe multilingual mis-recognition** in Gemini Live input transcriptions:

- User speaking clear English was intermittently transcribed as Arabic/Thai/Vietnamese tokens.
- Diagnostics confirmed that `caller_to_provider.wav` contained intelligible English with high offline STT confidence.

**Finding**:

- The **Golden Baseline setup did not send any `realtimeInputConfig` field** (commit `d4affe8`).
- Removing `realtimeInputConfig` and reverting to the baseline payload (commit `2597f63`) immediately restored correct, stable English recognition on new calls (e.g. call `1763333755.5693`).

**Lesson**:

- For this telephony ExternalMedia RTP configuration, **do not set `realtimeInputConfig` for Google Live**.
- Rely on Gemini Live's default activity detection and use the **system prompt** (context `demo_google_live`) to constrain language to English.
- If multilingual drift appears on otherwise clean audio, first check for any non-baseline `realtimeInputConfig` fields in the setup payload.

- Audio input: $0.025 per million audio seconds ($0.025 per ~278 hours)
- Audio output: $0.125 per million audio seconds ($0.125 per ~278 hours)

**Example Cost (1-minute call)**:
- Input: 60 seconds = $0.0000015
- Output: 60 seconds = $0.0000075
- **Total**: ~$0.000009 per call

**Daily Volume Examples**:
- 100 calls/day: ~$0.90/day = ~$27/month
- 1,000 calls/day: ~$9/day = ~$270/month
- 10,000 calls/day: ~$90/day = ~$2,700/month

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

```prometheus
# Response latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(ai_response_latency_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Success rate
rate(ai_calls_completed_total[5m]) / rate(ai_calls_started_total[5m])

# Tool execution success
rate(ai_tool_executions_total{status="success"}[5m])

# Transcription completion
