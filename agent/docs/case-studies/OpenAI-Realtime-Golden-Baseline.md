## Lessons Learned & Critical Fixes

### 1. Response Consistency (Temperature & Max Tokens)

**Problem**: OpenAI Realtime API occasionally generated text-only responses or skipped responses entirely, causing silent periods and conversation failures.

**Root Cause**: Default API behavior is conservative; may decide not to generate audio for certain inputs.

**Solution**:
```yaml
temperature: 0.8                      # Encourages more consistent audio generation
max_response_output_tokens: 4096      # Prevents premature response truncation
```

**Impact**: Significantly reduced silent response frequency, improved conversation flow.

### 2. Hangup Reliability (5-Second Timeout Fallback)

**Problem**: When OpenAI failed to generate farewell audio, call remained open indefinitely. User had to manually hang up.

**Example Failure**:
```
📞 Hangup tool executed
🔚 Farewell response created
⚠️ Farewell response completed WITHOUT audio - skipping hangup
[Call remains open - user hangs up manually]
```

**Root Cause**: Hangup logic waited for farewell audio completion, but OpenAI sometimes returns `response.done` without generating audio.

**Solution**: Add 5-second timeout fallback
```python
# Start timeout when farewell response is created
self._farewell_timeout_task = asyncio.create_task(self._farewell_timeout_handler())

# Cancel timeout if audio completes normally
if had_audio_burst:
    self._cancel_farewell_timeout()
    emit HangupReady event immediately
else:
    # Timeout will emit HangupReady after 5 seconds
    pass
```

**Behavior**:
- **With audio**: Immediate hangup (existing behavior)
- **Without audio**: 5-second delay then hangup (fallback)
- **Result**: 100% hangup reliability

### 3. VAD Sensitivity Tuning

**Problem**: Default VAD threshold (0.6) sometimes missed user speech or delayed turn detection.

**Solution**:
```yaml
turn_detection:
  threshold: 0.5           # More sensitive (was 0.6)
  silence_duration_ms: 600 # Faster cutoff (was 700)
```

**Impact**: Better speech detection, faster turn-taking.

### 4. Audio Generation Instructions

**Problem**: Model may skip audio generation even when temperature and max_tokens are set.

**Solution**: Explicit instructions
```yaml
instructions: |
  CRITICAL: ALWAYS respond with AUDIO to every user input.
  NEVER skip responses or generate text-only outputs.
```

**Impact**: Reduced (but did not eliminate) silent responses.

### 5. Known API Limitation (Modalities Bug)

**Important**: Even with optimal configuration, OpenAI Realtime API may occasionally:
- Generate text-only responses (no `response.audio.delta` events)
- Skip audio generation entirely
- Return `response.done` without audio

**Mitigation**: 5-second timeout ensures call always ends, even when API skips audio.

### 6. VAD Fallback Timer (Added December 2025)

**Problem**: VAD (turn detection) was sometimes not re-enabled after greeting, blocking user speech.

**Root Cause**: The greeting completion detection relied on response.done event which sometimes didn't fire correctly.

**Solution**: Added 5-second fallback timer after greeting is sent:
```python
async def _greeting_vad_fallback(self):
    await asyncio.sleep(5.0)
    if not self._greeting_completed:
        self._greeting_completed = True
        await self._re_enable_vad()
```

**Impact**: Guarantees two-way conversation can proceed even if greeting detection fails.

### 7. Echo Gating Fix (December 2025)

**Problem**: Echo gating was checking `len(_outbuf) > 0` but the pacer fills `_outbuf` with silence indefinitely, blocking ALL user input.

**Solution**: Check pacer underruns instead of buffer state:
```python
# Old (broken):
if len(self._outbuf) > 0:  # Always true - pacer fills with silence
    return  # Block forever

# New (fixed):
if self._in_audio_burst and self._pacer_underruns == 0:  # Only block during real audio
    return
```

**Impact**: User audio flows correctly after agent finishes speaking.

3. **Log Retention**: Keep 30-day logs for conversation analysis
4. **Cost Monitoring**: Track per-call costs via Prometheus metrics
5. **Fallback Provider**: Consider Google Live or Deepgram as backup

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Call doesn't hang up after agent says goodbye

**Symptoms**: Agent says farewell but call remains open

**Root Cause**: OpenAI API limitation - occasionally skips audio generation

**Solution**: Already implemented! 5-second timeout will trigger hangup automatically.

**Expected Logs**:
```
⚠️ Farewell response completed WITHOUT audio
⏱️ Farewell timeout expired - triggering hangup anyway
```

**Action**: None required - timeout handles gracefully

---

### Issue: Frequent silent responses mid-conversation

**Symptoms**: Agent doesn't respond to some user inputs

**Root Cause**: Temperature too low or API conservative behavior

**Solution**: Verify temperature and max_tokens are set:
```yaml
temperature: 0.8
max_response_output_tokens: 4096
```

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check container logs for config
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "OpenAI temperature"
```

---

### Issue: VAD too slow to detect speech

**Symptoms**: Long delay before agent responds

**Root Cause**: VAD threshold too high

**Solution**: Lower threshold to 0.5:
```yaml
turn_detection:
  threshold: 0.5
  silence_duration_ms: 600
```

---

### Issue: High costs

**Symptoms**: OpenAI bills higher than expected

**Root Cause**: Long calls or high call volume

**Mitigation**:
1. Monitor per-call duration via Prometheus
2. Implement call time limits
3. Consider Deepgram for cost-sensitive use cases
4. Use hangup_call tool to end calls promptly

---

### Issue: Audio quality degradation

**Symptoms**: Choppy or robotic audio

**Root Cause**: Network issues or resampling problems

**Solution**:
1. Check network latency to OpenAI
2. Verify RTP port 18080 is reachable
3. Review logs for resampling warnings
4. Test with different codec (slin vs ulaw)

## Conclusion

OpenAI Realtime provider is **production-ready** with documented API limitations and robust fallback mechanisms. The combination of temperature tuning (0.8), max token limits (4096), explicit audio instructions, and 5-second hangup timeout provides excellent reliability for general-purpose conversational AI applications.

**Key Strengths**:
- ✅ GPT-4 Omni reasoning capabilities
- ✅ Robust tool calling support
