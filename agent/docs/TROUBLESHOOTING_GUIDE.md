## Quick Diagnostics

### Step 1: Run Health Check

```bash
agent check
```

This performs comprehensive system checks:
- ✅ Docker containers running
- ✅ Asterisk ARI connectivity
- ✅ AudioSocket/RTP availability
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Provider API connectivity
- ✅ Recent call history

For full-local demos, also run:

```bash
agent check --local
```

This validates `local_ai_server` STT/LLM/TTS and reports the active Faster-Whisper device/compute, LLM context/max tokens/tool capability, GPU runtime status, and runtime flags such as `LOCAL_ENABLE_FILLER_AUDIO` and `LOCAL_LLM_STREAMING_TTS_OVERLAP`. For a CPU-only demo, the fast baseline is Faster-Whisper `tiny.en` on `cpu/int8`, Piper TTS, and a small GGUF LLM such as Qwen 2.5 0.5B or 1.5B.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - All checks passed
- `1` - Warnings (non-critical issues)
- `2` - Failures (critical issues)

### Call History DB (if missing or empty)

Call History is stored in a SQLite DB under `./data` on the host (mounted into `ai_engine` as `/app/data`).

Quick checks:
```bash
ls -la ./data
docker compose logs ai_engine | grep -i \"call history\" | tail -n 20
```

Common fixes:
- Run `sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes` (creates `./data` and `./models/*`, fixes permissions, applies SELinux contexts where applicable).
- Avoid non-local filesystems for `./data` (some NFS setups can break SQLite locking).

### Admin UI Shows “AI Engine/Local AI Server Error” But Containers Are Running (Tier 3 / Best-effort)

This is most common on Tier 3 hosts (Docker Desktop, Podman, unsupported distros) where:
- the Admin UI can’t reach the Docker API socket, and/or
- the Admin UI health probes are using URLs that aren’t reachable from inside the `admin_ui` container.

Quick checks:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

If container control (start/stop/restart) fails from the UI:
- Ensure the Docker socket is mounted and set in `.env` (varies by host):
  - Docker Desktop: `DOCKER_SOCK=/var/run/docker.sock`
  - Rootless Docker/Podman: often `DOCKER_SOCK=/run/user/<uid>/docker.sock`
- Then recreate the Admin UI container so the mount updates:
```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate admin_ui
```

If the UI shows a 500 error and `admin_ui` logs contain `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied` for `/var/run/docker.sock`:
- Your host’s `docker` group GID may not be `999` (Debian often differs), so the Admin UI user (UID 1000) can’t open the socket.
- Fix by setting `DOCKER_GID` to the socket’s group ID and recreating `admin_ui`:
```bash
ls -ln /var/run/docker.sock
DOCKER_GID=$(ls -ln /var/run/docker.sock | awk '{print $4}')
grep -qE '^[# ]*DOCKER_GID=' .env && sed -i.bak -E "s/^[# ]*DOCKER_GID=.*/DOCKER_GID=$DOCKER_GID/" .env || echo "DOCKER_GID=$DOCKER_GID" >> .env
docker compose up -d --force-recreate admin_ui
```

If containers are running but the UI shows “unreachable”:
- Set explicit health probe URLs in `.env` (values must be reachable from `admin_ui`):
```bash
HEALTH_CHECK_AI_ENGINE_URL=http://ai_engine:15000/health
HEALTH_CHECK_LOCAL_AI_URL=ws://local_ai_server:8765
```

Notes:
- The **Local AI Server is optional** unless you plan to use local STT/TTS models.
- If you run **bridge networking** and want Local AI Server reachable across containers, set:
  - `LOCAL_WS_HOST=0.0.0.0`
  - `LOCAL_WS_AUTH_TOKEN=...` (required; server refuses to start if exposed without auth)

### Step 2: Analyze Recent Call

```bash
agent rca
```

Automatically analyzes your most recent call with:
- Canonical outcome, provider/pipeline, duration, and latency from Call History
- Call-scoped log collection and parsing
- Metrics extraction
- Format alignment check
- Baseline comparison
- Optional AI-powered interpretation

**How it works:**
- Reads the persisted Call History record first so unrelated provider names in other log lines cannot select the wrong baseline
- Reads logs directly from Docker: `docker logs ai_engine`
- Analyzes calls from last 24 hours
- No file logging required (LOG_TO_FILE not needed)
- Requires `ai_engine` container to be running
- Works with both console and JSON log formats
- Treats delivery drift as observational; drift alone does not make a successful call fail

**Log Format Recommendation:**
For best troubleshooting results, use JSON format in `.env`:
```bash
LOG_FORMAT=json  # Recommended for structured analysis
```

Console format works too, but JSON provides:
- More reliable parsing (no ANSI color codes)
- Structured data for better analysis
- Easier field extraction

**Analyze most recent call:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Advanced (legacy alias): list recent calls:**
```bash
agent troubleshoot --list
```

## Common Issues

### 0. Docker Build Fails (apt-get / DNS)

**Symptoms:** `docker compose up -d --build ai_engine` fails with errors like:
- `Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'`
- `E: Unable to locate package build-essential`

**Cause:** Docker/BuildKit can’t resolve DNS or doesn’t have outbound internet during image build. This is not related to your host Debian version (Debian inside the image can differ).

**Fix (recommended):**
```bash
# Pull latest fixes (pins the base image to Debian 12/bookworm)
git pull

# Rebuild the engine image
docker compose build --no-cache --pull ai_engine
docker compose up -d ai_engine
```

**If DNS is still failing inside Docker:**
```bash
# Quick DNS probe inside a container
docker run --rm busybox:1.36.1 nslookup deb.debian.org
```

If the DNS probe fails, set explicit DNS servers for Docker and restart it:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker
printf '{\"dns\":[\"1.1.1.1\",\"8.8.8.8\"]}\n' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

If you’re on a Debian/Ubuntu host using `systemd-resolved`, also confirm Docker isn’t inheriting a loopback resolver (e.g. `127.0.0.53`):
```bash
readlink -f /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

### 1. No Audio (Complete Silence)

**Symptoms:** Neither caller nor agent can hear anything.

**Quick Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Common Causes:**

#### Transport Configuration Issue
```bash
# Check transport mode
grep audio_transport config/ai-agent.yaml

# Check container logs for transport startup
docker logs ai_engine | grep -iE "transport|audiosocket|externalmedia"
```

**Fix:** Verify your transport matches your provider:
```yaml
# For full agents (Deepgram, OpenAI Realtime)
audio_transport: audiosocket
audiosocket:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8090
  format: "ulaw"  # or "slin16"

# For pipelines (hybrid, local_only)
audio_transport: externalmedia
external_media:
  rtp_host: "0.0.0.0"
  rtp_port: 18080
  # Optional: allocate per-call RTP ports
  # port_range: "18080:18099"
```

#### Dialplan Not Passing to Stasis
**Check** your dialplan in `/etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf`:
```
[from-ai-agent]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Voice Agent)
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)  ; ← Must pass to Stasis app
 same => n,Hangup()
```

**Fix:** Ensure you're calling `Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)`, not `AudioSocket()`.  
The `ai_engine` service creates AudioSocket/RTP channels automatically via ARI.

#### Container Not Running
```bash
docker ps | grep ai_engine
```

**Fix:** Start container:
```bash
docker compose up -d ai_engine
```

---

### 2. Garbled/Distorted Audio

**Symptoms:** Audio is fast, slow, choppy, robotic, or distorted.

**Quick Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Common Causes:**

#### Audio Format Configuration
Check your transport format configuration.

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker logs ai_engine | grep -i "format\|transport"
```

**For AudioSocket transport (full agents):**
```yaml
audiosocket:
  format: "slin"  # PCM16 format
```

**For ExternalMedia RTP (pipelines):**  
Format is automatically managed based on provider configuration.

#### Jitter Buffer Underflows
**Symptoms:** Choppy, stuttering audio.

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker logs ai_engine | grep -i underflow
```

**Fix:** Increase buffer size in `config/ai-agent.yaml`:
```yaml
streaming:
  jitter_buffer_ms: 100  # Increase if underflows occur (default: 50)
```

#### Provider Bytes Pacing Bug
**Check with troubleshoot:**
```bash
agent rca
```

Look for: "Provider bytes ratio" should be `~1.0`.
- ❌ Ratio `<0.95` or `>1.05` = CRITICAL pacing bug

**Fix:** This usually indicates a code bug. Check:
- Provider output format matches expected
- No duplicate byte counting
- Streaming manager receiving correct byte counts

#### Sample Rate Mismatch
**Expected flow:**
- Asterisk → AudioSocket: 8kHz PCM16 (slin)
- `ai_engine` ↔ Provider: Provider's native rate
- `ai_engine` → Asterisk: 8kHz PCM16 (slin)

**Check config:**
```yaml
streaming:
  sample_rate: 8000  # Must be 8kHz for telephony
```

---

### 3. Echo (Agent Hears Itself)

**Symptoms:** Agent responds to its own output, creating confusion or loops.

**Quick Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Common Causes:**

#### VAD Too Sensitive (OpenAI Realtime)
**CRITICAL SETTING** for OpenAI Realtime API:

```yaml
vad:
  webrtc_aggressiveness: 1  # NOT 0!
```

**Why:** Level 0 detects echo as "speech", causing gate flutter.

**Verify:**
```bash
docker logs ai_engine | grep "webrtc_aggressiveness"
```

**Expected:** `webrtc_aggressiveness=1`

#### Audio Gate Flutter
**Symptoms:** Gate opening/closing rapidly (50+ times per call).

**Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

Look for: "Gate closures: XX"
- ✅ `<5` closures = Normal
- ⚠️ `5-20` closures = Elevated
- ❌ `>20` closures = Flutter (echo leakage)

**Fix:**
```yaml
vad:
  webrtc_aggressiveness: 1
  confidence_threshold: 0.6
  post_tts_end_protection_ms: 250  # Prevents premature reopening
```

#### Provider Echo Cancellation Not Working
**For OpenAI Realtime:** Has built-in server-side echo cancellation.
**Solution:** Let OpenAI handle it, keep local VAD at level 1.

**For Deepgram:** May need to adjust settings or use barge-in config.

---

### 4. Self-Interruption Loop

**Symptoms:** Agent cuts itself off mid-sentence repeatedly.

**Quick Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Cause:** This is a variant of echo issue - agent hearing its own audio.

**Fix:** Same as Echo troubleshooting above:
1. Set `webrtc_aggressiveness: 1`
2. Increase `post_tts_end_protection_ms`
3. Check for gate flutter

---

### 5. One-Way Audio

**Symptoms:** Only caller OR only agent can be heard.

**Quick Check:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Diagnose Direction:**

#### Caller Can't Hear Agent (TTS Issue)
**Check:**
```bash
docker logs ai_engine | grep -i "playback\|tts\|playing"
```

**No playback logs?**
- Provider API key invalid or missing
- TTS provider down or unreachable
- Format encoding issue (check transport mode)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify API keys in .env
grep -E "OPENAI_API_KEY|DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" .env

# Test provider connectivity
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

#### Agent Can't Hear Caller (STT Issue)
**Check:**
```bash
docker logs ai_engine | grep -i "transcript\|stt\|speech"
```

**No transcription logs?**
- Provider API key invalid
- AudioSocket not receiving audio
- Format mismatch preventing STT

**Fix:**
1. Verify API keys
2. Check AudioSocket connectivity
3. Verify format: `slin` at 8kHz

---

### 6. Caller Inactivity Watchdog Does Not Check In or Hang Up

**Expected v7.3.1 behavior:** once the call is ready and both sides are idle, the inbound watchdog asks “Are you still there?” after 30 seconds, waits 15 seconds, speaks the full final warning, then records `no_input_timeout` and hangs up.

Check the effective configuration:

```yaml
no_input:
  enabled: true
  inbound_enabled: true
  initial_timeout_sec: 30
  grace_timeout_sec: 15
  max_check_ins: 1
```

Then search the call logs for:

```text
Caller inactivity watchdog registered
Caller inactivity check-in
Caller-facing audio drain complete
Caller inactivity timeout reached
Executing terminal ARI hangup
```

If the timer never starts, check for a stuck `processing`, caller-input, transfer, or output-active state. If announcements play but hangup is late, upgrade to v7.3.1 or newer; older native-AEC paths could wait 25 seconds because output completion was coupled to TTS gating. For ElevenLabs, enable `agent_response_complete`, set its hosted turn timeout to 30 seconds, and disable provider silence hangup (`silence_end_call_timeout: -1`). Outbound calls require an explicit per-agent `outbound_enabled: true` override.

## Troubleshooting Tools

### agent check

**System health check and diagnostics.**

```bash
# Basic health check
agent check

# JSON output (for scripts)
agent check --json

# Verbose output
agent check -v
```

**What it checks:**
- Docker containers (`ai_engine`, `local_ai_server`, monitoring)
- Asterisk ARI (connectivity, authentication)
- AudioSocket (port 8090 availability)
- Configuration (YAML validation, required fields)
- Provider APIs (key validation, connectivity)
- Recent calls (last 24 hours)

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` = All checks passed
- `1` = Warnings detected
- `2` = Critical failures

**Use Cases:**
- Pre-flight checks before deployment
- CI/CD validation
- Post-deployment verification
- Scheduled monitoring

---

### agent rca

**Post-call analysis and root cause analysis.**

```bash
# Analyze most recent call
agent rca

# Analyze specific call
agent rca --call 1761424308.2043

# JSON output (JSON only)
agent rca --json

# Verbose output
agent rca -v

# Force LLM analysis (even for healthy calls)
agent rca --llm

# Deterministic evidence only (recommended for automation)
agent rca --call 1761424308.2043 --no-llm --json

# Latest persisted local/pipeline call and Community Test Matrix data
agent rca --local
```

**What it analyzes:**
- **Call History:** Canonical provider/pipeline, outcome, duration, turns, latency, routing, and codec result
- **Call Logs:** Filters diagnostic evidence for the selected call ID
- **Metrics:** Provider bytes, drift, underflows, SNR
- **Format Alignment:** AudioSocket, provider, frame sizes
- **VAD Settings:** Aggressiveness, thresholds
- **Audio Gating:** Gate closures, flutter detection
- **Baseline Comparison:** vs golden configs
- **Quality Score:** Deterministic score based on actionable metrics
- **LLM Diagnosis:** AI-powered root cause analysis

Delivery wall time includes pauses, barge-in, synthesis, and queue waits. RCA therefore reports drift as evidence but does not fail a call or invoke LLM diagnosis from drift alone. Modular pipeline wall time and very short/empty segments are excluded from drift assessment. Underflows are rated against the estimated number of 20 ms frames rather than by raw count alone.

**Symptoms Supported:**
- `no-audio` - Complete silence
- `garbled` - Distorted/fast/slow audio
- `echo` - Agent hears itself
- `interruption` - Self-interruption loop
- `one-way` - Only one direction works

**Output Sections:**
1. Pipeline Status (AudioSocket, Transcription, Playback)
2. Audio Issues (underflows, format mismatches)
3. Errors & Warnings
4. Symptom Analysis (if specified)
5. Detailed Metrics (RCA-level)
6. Call Quality Verdict (0-100 score)
7. AI Diagnosis (if enabled)

Note: Advanced `agent troubleshoot` flags (list/symptoms/collect-only/etc.) remain as a hidden compatibility path, but `agent rca` is the recommended surface.

---

### agent demo (legacy)

`agent demo` is a hidden compatibility alias for `agent check`. The old `--wav`, `--loop`, and `--save` workflow is no longer implemented; those flags return an explicit error. Validate a real audio path with a test call followed by `agent rca`.

---

### agent setup

**Interactive setup wizard.**

```bash
# Run setup wizard
agent setup

# Show targets discovered from base and local configuration without changing files
agent setup --list-targets
```

**What it configures:**
- Asterisk ARI credentials
- Audio transport (AudioSocket/ExternalMedia)
- AI provider selection
- Pipeline configuration
- Configuration validation

The wizard writes operator changes to `config/ai-agent.local.yaml`. Switching from a pipeline to a full-agent provider clears the previous `active_pipeline` override.

---

## Debugging Tool Execution Issues

**Tool execution** allows AI agents to perform actions like call transfers, hangups, and sending emails. When tools don't work, follow this debugging workflow.

### HTTP Phase Tools (Pre/In/Post Call)

If you are troubleshooting **pre-call HTTP lookups**, **in-call HTTP tools**, or **post-call webhooks**:

- **Template variables** use the *variable name* (e.g., `{patient_id}`), not the JSON extraction path (e.g., `patient.id`).
- In the Admin UI, the variable names you can reuse elsewhere are highlighted in the HTTP tool editors.
- With `LOG_LEVEL=debug`, the engine emits `[HTTP_TOOL_TRACE]` logs showing the resolved request (URL/headers/body), referenced variable values, and a bounded response preview.

```bash
# Show HTTP tool request/response traces (requires LOG_LEVEL=debug)
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "\\[HTTP_TOOL_TRACE\\]"
```

### Quick Diagnostics for Tool Issues

```bash
# 1. Collect standard diagnostics
agent check

# 2. Review most recent call for tool execution
agent rca

# 3. Look for tool-specific errors
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep -i "tool\|function"
```

### Common Tool Execution Problems

#### Tools Not Executing (Generic)

**Symptom**: AI mentions action ("I'll transfer you") but nothing happens.

**Diagnostic Steps**:

1. **Verify tools are configured:**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "tools:" config/ai-agent.yaml
   ```
   Should list enabled tools for your pipeline/provider.

2. **Check tool registration in logs:**
   ```bash
   docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "tools configured"
   ```
   Expected pattern:
   ```
   ✅ "OpenAI session configured with 6 tools"
   ✅ "Added tools to provider context: ['transfer', 'hangup_call', ...]"
   ```

3. **Look for tool invocation:**
   ```bash
   docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "function call\|tool call"
   ```
   Expected patterns:
   ```
   ✅ "OpenAI function call detected: hangup_call"
   ✅ "Tool hangup_call executed: success"
   ```

**If No Tool Registration**:
- Check `config/ai-agent.yaml` under your pipeline's `tools:` section
- Ensure tools are listed (e.g., `- hangup_call`, `- transfer`)
- Restart containers after config changes

#### OpenAI Realtime: Schema Format Error

**Symptom**: Error `Missing required parameter: 'session.tools[0].name'`

**Root Cause**: Using Chat Completions schema format instead of Realtime API format.

**Diagnostic**:
```bash
# Look for schema error
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "missing_required_parameter"
```

**Fix**: This is a code issue (should be fixed in v4.2+). If you see this error:
- Verify you're on latest version: `agent update` (or `git pull origin main`)
- Check that `src/tools/adapters/openai.py` uses `to_openai_realtime_schema()`
- See [Common Pitfalls](contributing/COMMON_PITFALLS.md#pitfall-1-tool-schema-format-mismatch-openai-realtime) for details

#### Deepgram: Functions Not Being Called

**Symptom**: Deepgram configured but never calls functions.

**Diagnostic**:
```bash
# Check for FunctionCallRequest events
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep "FunctionCallRequest"
```

**Common Issues**:
- Using `agent.think.tools` instead of `agent.think.functions` (wrong field name)
- Event handler checking `"function_call"` instead of `"FunctionCallRequest"`

**Fix**: Verify code uses Deepgram-specific naming (fixed in v4.1+).

#### Hangup Tool: Call Doesn't Disconnect

**Symptom**: AI says "goodbye" but call stays connected.

**Diagnostic Steps**:

1. **Check if tool was invoked:**
   ```bash
   docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep -i "hangup"
   ```
   Expected patterns:
   ```
   ✅ "Hangup requested"
   ✅ "Hangup tool executed"
   ✅ "Call will hangup after farewell"
   ```

2. **Check for execution errors:**
   ```bash
   docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep -i "AttributeError\|hangup.*error"
   ```

**Common Issues**:
- Wrong ARI method (using `delete_channel` instead of `hangup_channel`)
- Missing farewell playback (call hangs up too quickly)
- Tool not registered with provider

**Workaround**: If urgent, caller can hang up manually.

#### Transfer Tool: Not Transferring

**Symptom**: AI says "transferring you" but call doesn't transfer.

**Diagnostic**:
```bash
# Check transfer execution
docker logs ai_engine 2>&1 | grep -i "transfer"
```

Expected patterns:
```
✅ "Transfer tool invoked"
✅ "Resolved destination: ringgroup 600"
✅ "Transfer initiated"
```

**Common Issues**:
- Destination not found (extension/queue/ringgroup doesn't exist in Asterisk)
- ARI redirect/continue failure
- Transfer active flag not set correctly

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check Asterisk for destination
asterisk -rx "core show hints" | grep <extension>
asterisk -rx "queue show <queue-name>"
```

### Using agent rca for Tool Issues

Use `agent rca` as the first stop for tool execution issues:

```bash
# Analyze most recent call (includes tool execution sections)
agent rca

# Look for these sections in output:
# 1. Tool Registration: "Tools configured: 6"
# 2. Tool Invocations: "function_call detected"
# 3. Tool Results: "executed: success" or "executed: failure"
# 4. Errors: AttributeError, missing methods, schema errors
```

### Expected Log Patterns for Successful Tool Execution

**OpenAI Realtime**:
```
[info] Added tools to provider context: ['transfer', 'cancel_transfer', 'hangup_call', ...]
[info] Generated OpenAI Realtime schemas for 6 tools
[info] OpenAI session configured with 6 tools
[info] OpenAI function call detected: hangup_call (call_id_...)
[info] Hangup requested: farewell="Thank you for calling!"
[info] Hangup tool executed - next response will trigger hangup
[info] HangupReady event received - executing hangup
```

**Deepgram Voice Agent**:
```
[info] Configured agent.think.functions for Deepgram
[info] FunctionCallRequest event received
[info] Function: blind_transfer, parameters: {destination: 'sales'}
[info] Transfer tool executed: success
```

**Pipelines (OpenAI Chat Completions)**:
```
[info] LLM response contains tool_calls
[info] Tool call: hangup_call
[info] Executing tool via tool_registry
[info] Tool hangup_call executed: success
```

### Warning Patterns (Tool Issues)

```
⚠️ "AI used farewell phrase without invoking hangup_call tool"
   → Tool not being called by LLM

❌ "Missing required parameter: 'session.tools[0].name'"
   → Schema format mismatch (OpenAI Realtime)

❌ "AttributeError: 'Engine' object has no attribute 'app_config'"
   → Code bug in tool context creation

❌ "AttributeError: 'ARIClient' object has no attribute 'delete_channel'"
   → Wrong ARI method name
```

## Advanced (Legacy) Symptom Flags

`agent rca` is the recommended v5.0 surface. If you need symptom-focused heuristics, the hidden legacy alias `agent troubleshoot` supports:

```bash
agent troubleshoot --last --symptom <no-audio|garbled|echo|interruption|one-way>
```

## Log Analysis

### Manual Log Review

```bash
# Recent logs (last hour)
docker logs --since 1h ai_engine

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f ai_engine

# Search for specific call

### Key Log Patterns

#### Successful Call Indicators
```
✅ "AudioSocket connection accepted"
✅ "Transcription:" or "transcript:"
✅ "Playback started" or "playing audio"
✅ "Provider bytes" ratio ~1.0
✅ Drift <10%
```

#### Problem Indicators
```
❌ "Connection refused" or "Connection failed"
❌ "Format mismatch" or "format error"
❌ "Underflow" (especially >50 per call)
❌ "Provider bytes" ratio <0.95 or >1.05
❌ Drift >10%
❌ Gate closures >20
```

### Log Levels

Adjust logging in `.env`:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug    # Most verbose (use for troubleshooting)
LOG_LEVEL=info     # Default (recommended)
LOG_LEVEL=warning  # Quiet (only warnings and errors)
LOG_LEVEL=error    # Very quiet (only errors)

# Streaming-specific logging
STREAMING_LOG_LEVEL=debug  # Detailed streaming logs
```

## Provider-Specific Issues

### OpenAI Realtime

#### Common Issues

**1. WebRTC VAD Sample Rate Error**
```
ERROR: WebRTC VAD error - sample rate must be 8000, 16000, or 32000
```

**Cause:** OpenAI outputs 24kHz, incompatible with WebRTC VAD.

**Fix:** Not yet fixed - tracked in AAVA-27.

**2. Model Not Found**
```
ERROR: received 4000 (private use) invalid_request_error.missing_model
```

**Cause:** Wrong model specified for Realtime API.

**Fix:** Use a current GA Realtime model (OpenAI sunset the Beta Realtime API on 2026-05-12 and removed `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-*` snapshots on 2026-05-07):
```yaml
providers:
  openai_realtime:
    api_version: ga
    model: gpt-realtime         # NOT gpt-4o, NOT gpt-4o-realtime-preview-*
    # Other current GA options: gpt-realtime-1.5 (best audio quality),
    #                           gpt-realtime-2 (reasoning voice model),
    #                           gpt-realtime-mini (cost-optimized).
```
If you see `error.code: model_not_found` despite a valid key, your OpenAI org may not have Realtime API access enabled — check **OpenAI Console → Settings → Limits**.

**3. Authentication Failed**
```
ERROR: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Fix:** Verify API key in `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

### Deepgram Voice Agent

#### Common Issues

**1. Low RMS Warnings (Spam)**
```
WARNING: Low RMS level detected in audio
```

**Cause:** Deepgram API sensitivity - not actually a problem.

**Fix:** These warnings are suppressed by default. If seeing many:
- Check actual audio quality with test call
- Ignore if audio sounds good

**2. Connection Timeout**
```
ERROR: Deepgram connection timeout
```

**Fix:**
- Check API key: `grep DEEPGRAM_API_KEY .env`
- Verify network connectivity
- Check Deepgram service status

**3. Format Encoding Issues**
```
ERROR: Unsupported audio format
```

**Fix:** Verify config:
```yaml
providers:
  deepgram:
    encoding: "mulaw"  # or "linear16"
    sample_rate: 8000
```

### Local AI (Vosk + Phi-3 + Piper)

#### Common Issues

**1. Models Not Loading**
```
ERROR: Model file not found
```

**Fix:** Run model setup:
```bash
make model-setup
```

If you see permission errors (for example `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied` when the UI tries to download models), fix host mounts/permissions first:
```bash
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes
docker compose up -d --force-recreate local_ai_server
```

Or check specific paths in `.env`:
```bash
LOCAL_STT_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/stt/vosk-model-en-us-0.22
LOCAL_LLM_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/llm/phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
LOCAL_TTS_MODEL_PATH=/app/models/tts/en_US-lessac-medium.onnx
```

**2. Slow LLM Responses (>10 seconds)**

**Cause:** CPU performance - Phi-3 needs modern hardware.

**Hardware Requirements:**
- CPU: 2020+ (Ryzen 9 5950X / i9-11900K or newer)
- RAM: 8GB+
- GPU: Optional (RTX 3060+) for faster inference

**Fix:**
- Reduce context: `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT=2048`
- Reduce max tokens: `LOCAL_LLM_MAX_TOKENS=32`
- Or switch to local_hybrid (local STT/TTS, cloud LLM)

**3. Container Restart Loop**
```
docker ps  # local_ai_server keeps restarting
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker logs local_ai_server
```

Common causes:
- Insufficient RAM (needs 8GB+)
- Missing model files
- Port conflict (8765)

## Performance Issues

### High Latency

**Symptoms:** >2 second delay between speech and response.

**Diagnose:**
```bash
agent rca
```

Look for:
- Provider API response times
- Network latency
- LLM generation time

**Fixes:**

#### Cloud Providers (OpenAI, Deepgram)
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API endpoints accessible
- Use geographically closer regions if available

#### Local AI
- Reduce LLM context size
- Reduce max_tokens
- Enable GPU acceleration (if available)
- Consider hybrid mode (cloud LLM only)

### High CPU/Memory Usage

**Check resource usage:**
```bash
docker stats ai_engine local_ai_server
```

**Normal Usage:**
- `ai_engine`: <20% CPU, <512MB RAM
- local_ai_server: 50-100% CPU (during inference), 4-8GB RAM

**High usage causes:**
- Multiple concurrent calls
- Large LLM models
- Debug logging enabled

**Fixes:**
- Scale horizontally (multiple containers)
- Use smaller models
- Reduce logging: `LOG_LEVEL=warning`
- Enable GPU acceleration

### Audio Quality Degradation

**Check metrics:**
```bash
agent rca
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Drift:** Should be <10%
- **Underflows:** <1% of frames
- **Provider bytes ratio:** 0.99-1.01
- **Quality Score:** >70

**If score <70:**
1. Check format alignment
2. Increase jitter buffer
3. Verify network stability
4. Check provider API health

## Network Issues

### Connectivity Problems

#### Can't Reach Asterisk ARI
```bash
# Test ARI connectivity
curl -u asterisk:asterisk http://127.0.0.1:8088/ari/asterisk/info

# Container-side ARI probe (recommended in v5.0; avoids requiring curl/ping in ai_engine)
agent check
```

**Fix:** Update `.env`:
```bash
ASTERISK_HOST=127.0.0.1  # or remote IP/hostname
```

#### AudioSocket Port Not Accessible
```bash
# Check if port 8090 is listening
netstat -tuln | grep 8090

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status | grep 8090

# Test from Asterisk
telnet engine-host 8090
```

**Fix:** Open firewall port:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8090/tcp
```

#### Provider API Unreachable
```bash
# Test OpenAI
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Test Deepgram
curl https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen \
  -H "Authorization: Token $DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
```

**Fix:**
- Check API keys
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check corporate firewall/proxy

### Docker Networking

#### Host Network (Default in `docker-compose.yml`)

Most deployments use host networking for telephony/low-latency behavior.

**Verify:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

#### Bridge Network (Advanced / Optional)

If you run a custom bridge-network compose (not the default), port mappings are required:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8090:8090"      # AudioSocket
  - "18080:18080/udp"  # RTP
  - "15000:15000"    # Health
```

**Verify:**
```bash
docker ps | grep ai_engine
# Should show port mappings
```

**Security:** Bridge mode still requires strict firewall rules and allowlisting as appropriate for your deployment.

See: [docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md](PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### IPv6 (GA policy)

For GA stability, AAVA treats IPv6 as **best-effort**.

If IPv6 is enabled but not fully functional in your environment, you may see intermittent DNS/connectivity issues (especially in host-network Docker setups).

**Recommendation (host-level):** disable IPv6 on the host running AAVA.

Temporary (until reboot):
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
```

Persistent:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-ipv6.conf
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
EOF
sudo sysctl --system
```

## Docker Build Issues

### DNS Resolution Failure During Build

**Symptom:** Docker build fails with DNS resolution errors:
```
Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement websockets
```

**Root Cause:** Docker BuildKit networking can't resolve DNS on some networks/systems.

**Solutions:**

#### Solution 1: Disable BuildKit (Simplest)
```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker compose build
```

#### Solution 2: Use Host Network for Build
```bash
docker build --network=host -t asterisk-ai-voice-agent-ai-engine ./
docker build --network=host -t asterisk-ai-voice-agent-local-ai-server ./local_ai_server
```

#### Solution 3: Configure Docker DNS
```bash
# Edit Docker daemon config
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Add:
```json
{
  "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
}
```

Then restart Docker:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### Solution 4: Check System DNS
```bash
# Verify DNS resolution works
nslookup pypi.org

# If not, fix system DNS
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# Add: nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

### Build Timeout or Slow Download

**Symptom:** Build hangs or times out downloading packages.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use pip mirror:**
   ```bash
   # In Dockerfile, change pip install to:
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -i https://pypi.org/simple/ -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Increase Docker timeout:**
   ```bash
   COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=200 docker compose build
   ```

3. **Build with verbose output:**
   ```bash
   docker compose build --progress=plain
   ```

### docker-compose vs docker compose

**Symptom:** `docker: 'compose' is not a docker command`

**Root Cause:** Older Docker installations (Debian/Ubuntu packages) use `docker-compose` (v1) not `docker compose` (v2).

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use docker-compose instead
docker compose up -d ai_engine admin_ui

# Or install Docker Compose v2
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-compose-plugin
```

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Standard diagnostics report (share this output when asking for help)
agent check

# Post-call RCA (most recent call)
agent rca

# Advanced (legacy alias): list recent calls / symptom heuristics
# agent troubleshoot --list
# agent troubleshoot --last --symptom garbled

# View logs
docker logs -f ai_engine

# Restart services
docker compose restart ai_engine
```

### Essential Configs

```yaml
# Correct AudioSocket format
audiosocket:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8090
  format: "slin"  # CRITICAL

# Optimal VAD for OpenAI
vad:
  webrtc_aggressiveness: 1  # NOT 0
  confidence_threshold: 0.6

# Buffer for stability
streaming:
  jitter_buffer_ms: 100
  sample_rate: 8000
```

### Essential Asterisk Dialplan

**The dialplan is the same regardless of transport mode.** Just pass the call to the Stasis application:

```
[from-ai-agent]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Voice Agent)
 same => n,Answer()
 same => n,Set(AI_AGENT=default)         ; Select an operator-managed agent
 ; same => n,Set(AI_PROVIDER=deepgram)  ; Optional provider/pipeline override
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

**Transport is controlled in config, not dialplan:**
- Set `audio_transport: externalmedia` for **pipelines** (hybrid, local_only)
- Set `audio_transport: audiosocket` for **full agents** (Deepgram, OpenAI Realtime)

The `ai_engine` service automatically creates the AudioSocket server or RTP endpoint based on your config. You don't need to add `AudioSocket()` to the dialplan.

**Agent Selection:**
Use `AI_AGENT` to select an operator-managed agent. Normally its configured target is authoritative; set `AI_PROVIDER` only for an intentional per-call provider or pipeline override. Generate a current snippet with `agent dialplan --agent <slug>`.

See [docs/Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md](Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md) for transport mode details.
